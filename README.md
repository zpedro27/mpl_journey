## Info
This repository contains plots made in the context of an online course on data visualization, [Matplotlib Journey](https://www.matplotlib-journey.com/). This course was created by Yan Holtz and Joseph Barbier and was launched in March 2025.

The repo contains visualizations split over two sections:

`./replicates` -> exercises where the goal was to reproduce some provided charts, in order to practice the use of some commands

`./originals` -> exercises where the goal was either (i) to improve pre-existing plots, or (ii) coming up with a visualization idea from scratch.
